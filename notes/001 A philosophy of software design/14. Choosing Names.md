# Choosing Names

> Name choice is an example of the principle that complexity is incremental.
> Choosing a mediocre name for a particular variable, as opposed to the best
> possible name, probably won't have much impact on the overall complexity
> of a system. However, software systems have thousands of variables;
> choosing good names for all of these will have a significant impact on
> complexity and manageability.

## Create an image

> When choosing a name, the goal is to create an image in the mind of the
> reader about the nature of the thing being named.


## A different opinion: Go style guide

> The Go culture encourages the use of the same short name for multiple
> different things: `ch` for character or channel, `d` for data, difference,
> or distances, and so on. To me, ambiguous names like these are likely to
> result in confusion and error, just as in the `block` example.
>
> Overall, I would argue that readability must be determined by readers,
> not writers.
