We write software with two goals in mind:

* solve the problem at hand
* continue to solve the problem in the future, as the scope of the problem
  expands

In turn, the scope expands in two ways:

* as we build a larger system, we initially choose to build only a subset of
  its full scope; inevitably, we need to expand that reduced scope in order
  to reach the actual goal
* alternatively, external requirements might change; assuming that our software
  serves a business, as that business expands its customer base - or as those
  customers change their needs - the business will redefine the original
  requirements presented to software creators

Of course, both source of scope expansion can occur simultaneously.

From the perspective of an engineer, when modelling the problem space, the above
can be translated into two sources of uncertainty regarding the correctness of the
software design:

* my current, limited understanding of the problem space; as I implement the
  system and expand its capabilities, I will refine my understanding of the
  concepts which best describe notions from the problem space
* changes in external requirements
