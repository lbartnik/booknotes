# Code Should be Obvious

> Obscurity is one of the two main causes of complexity described in
> Section 2.3 Obscurity occurs when important information about a system
> is not obvious to new developers.

> "Obvious" is in the mind of the reader (...)

> If someone reading your code says it's not obvious, then it's not
> obvious, no matter how clear it may seem to you.

## Red Flag: Nonobvious Code

> If the meaning and behavior of code cannot be understood with a quick
> reading, it is a red flag. Often this means that there is important
> information that is not immediately clear to someone reading the code.

## Conclusion

> Another way of thinking about obviousness is in terms of information.
> If code is nonobvious, that usually means there is important information
> about the code that the reader does not have: in the `RaftClient` example,
> the reader might not know that the `RaftClient` constructor created new
> threads; (...)
