## Information leakage

Example concludes that classes should be combined to keep all related
information in one place. Perhaps. However, one can imagine a situation where
both classes are fairly large and do not share much of their code. Then, even
from that point of view, there might value in keeping both classes around and
signalling their interdependenc by placing them in the same package or
namespace.

One could also recognize the file format itself (or the written specification)
as another interface present in the system and treat the reader and the writer
as two related modules which have the same dependency, a third non-code module.

Overall, this is a fairly good example but once again it points to a deeper
substructure related to concepts, behaviors and relations - a mental model of
the problem domain.
