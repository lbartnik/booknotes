A very interesting remark!


## A more general-purpose API

Is it because, when thinking of manipulating text, we imagine adding, removing,
replacing, etc. parts of the text rather than pressing backspace or delete on
the keyboard? If so, is it "more obvious" because it points to a more concise
language which can describe all of those text manipulations, that is also more
natural to our minds - to how we imagine text manipulations before we execute
them through the keyboard?

For example, I will rather think and state my goals in terms of "I am going to
move this paragraph upwards" than "I will press and hold Ctrl and then press
the down arrow 10 times"? The latter is what I have to do in order to achieve
the former - but it is a translation of the former to language appropriate for
a computer. If I was working with pen and paper, I'd rather translate the goal
of moving the paragraph into "I will circle the paragraph and draw and arrow
to where I think it should appear".

So, once again, it is about language.

This is because one needs to learn about the problem domain and learn the
appropriate language to talk about problems and solutions.
