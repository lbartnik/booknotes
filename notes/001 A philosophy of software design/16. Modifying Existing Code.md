# Modifying Existing Code

## Stay strategic

> As a result, the system design gets just a bit worse, and the problems
> accumulate with each step in the system's evolution. (...)
>
> Ideally, when you have finished with each change, the system will have
> the structure it would have had if you had designed it from the start
> with that change in mind.

> Whenever you modify any code, try to find a way to improve the system
> design at least a little bit in the process.

## Maintaining comments: keep the comments near the code

> In addition, many IDEs will extract and present documentation to users,
> such as by displaying a method's documentation when the method's name
> is typed. Given tools such as these, the documentation should be located
> in the place that is most convenient for development working on the code.

## Comments belong in the code, not the commit log

> This illustrates the principle of placing documentation in the place where
> developers are most likely to see it; the commit log is rarely that place.
