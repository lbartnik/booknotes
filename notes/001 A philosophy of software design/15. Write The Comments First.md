# Write The Comments First

## Comments are a design tool

> To write a good comment, you must identify the essence of a variable
> or piece of code: what are the most important aspects of this thing?
> It's important to do this early in the design process: otherwise, you
> are just hacking code.

## Early comments are fun comments

> If you are programming strategically, where your main goal is a great
> design rather than just writing code that works, then writing comments
> should be fun, since that's how you identify the best designs.

## Conclusion

> If you haven't ever tried writing the comments first, give it a try.
> Stick with it long enough to get used to it. Then think about how it
> affects the quality of your comments, the quality of your design, and
> your overall enjoyment of software development. After you have tried
> this for a while, let me know whether your experience matches mine,
> and why or why not.
