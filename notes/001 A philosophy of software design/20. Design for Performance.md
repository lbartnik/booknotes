# Design for Performance

## Measure before (and after) modifying

> Programmers' intuitions about performance are unreliable. This is true
> even for experienced developers.

## An Example: RAMCloud Buffers

> If there is no space available, or if the last chunk in the Buffer isn't
> an incremental chunk, or if the Buffer contains no chunks at all, then 
> `availableAppendBytes` is zero; three different special cases can be
> checked at once, just by testing `availableAppendBytes`.
